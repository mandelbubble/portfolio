                    <p>My name is Alex and I am a software developer. I fell in love with programming at twelve and never stopped since then. After five years as a Front-End then Fullstack engineer, I decided to take two years for myself to try my hands at everything I have ever dreamed of learning (from Blender to Unreal Engine to embedded electronics to watercolor paintings). On top of it, Iâ€™m a lucky mom since March 2023.</p>
                    <p>I am now eager to come back to work and very (very) excited to do so ! There are so many things I miss in my work such as always learning new things, team spirit, shipping meaningful features for end users and large scale architectures.</p>
                    <p>I have a strong interest for webGL and would love to make the leap from web applications to ambitious creative development projects.</p>
